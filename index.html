                         slices of roast beef simmered and served au jus on French bread. Common

                         The pan in which deep-dish pizza is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge,
                          which provides ample space for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce.
                           Chicago-style deep-dish pizza may be prepared either this way or stuffed.</p>
